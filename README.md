[![video](https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace/raw/master/image_src/35c3_lightning.jpg)](https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9566-lightning_talks_day_2#t=477)

This is a rewrite for the original [Kitspace](https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace) to use [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) as a Git and authentication service.

## Goals

Allow people to:

1. Add projects without knowing Git/Github
2. Still import/sync external Git repositories
3. Edit/make improvements and propose these changes to project creators

## Adding your project

Please edit the [boards.txt](boards.txt) file to add your git repo containing an electronics project. You can add a kitspace.yaml to make sure we find all the right files (details below). We will be improving this workflow, come [chat to us](https://app.element.io/#/room/#kitspace:matrix.org) in the meantime and we would be happy to help. 

### kitspace.yaml format

Currently the `kitspace.yaml` makes use of the following fields:

```yaml
summary: A description for your project

# A site you would like to link to (include http:// or https://)
site: https://example.com 

# The solder resist color of the preview rendering. 
color: purple 
  # If omitted "green" is used. Can be one of:
  # - green
  # - red
  # - blue
  # - black
  # - white
  # - orange
  # - purple
  # - yellow

# A path to your 1-click-bom in case it isn't `1-click-bom.tsv`. 
bom: my-bom.xlsx
  # Supported extensions are:
  # - .tsv
  # - .csv
  # - .ods
  # - .xlsx
  # Check out https://github.com/kitspace/1clickBOM#readme for more details

# A path to your folder of gerbers in case it isn't `gerbers/`.
gerbers: my/gerber/folder 

eda:
  type: kicad # or eagle
  pcb: path/to/your/file.kicad_pcb # your/eagle.brd

# A path to your README file in case it isn't in the repository root directory.
readme: my/special/readme.md 

pcb-services:
  [aisler, pcbway, oshpark, jlcpcb]
  # A list of the PCB services you would like to have included on your
  # page. If left undefined all are included. Otherwise ust be a list of Kitspace
  # sponsors, possible values are:
  #      - aisler
  #      - pcbway
  #      - oshpark
  #      - jlcpcb

# Disable InteractiveHtmlBom generation, enabled by default. (https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) 
ibom-enabled: false 

# Identifier field only used if the repository contains multiple projects. See below for details.
multi: 
```

Paths should be in UNIX style (i.e. use `/` not `\`) and relative to the root
of your repository. The YAML format is pretty straight forward but if you need
to know more check the example below and [the YAML website][6]. Use [this YAML
validator][yamllint] to be extra sure that your `kitspace.yaml` is valid.

### KiCad PCB

If you you used KiCad for your design you can also specify a KiCad PCB file to use by adding an `eda` field.

```yaml
eda:
  type: kicad
  pcb: path/to/your/file.kicad_pcb
```

If your project has a KiCad PCB or Eagle, an interactive assembly guide for the board will be created using the [Interactive HTML BOM plugin](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) from the [Open Scope Project](https://github.com/openscopeproject).

If both `eda` and `gerbers` are present the Gerber files will be used directly everywhere except for the Interactive HTML BOM. 

### Some examples

Check out the repo links of the projects listed on
[kitspace.org](https://kitspace.org) already. The minimum required file tree is
something like:

```
.
├── 1-click-bom.tsv
└── gerbers
    ├── example.cmp
    ├── example.drd
    ├── example.dri
    ├── example.gko
    ├── example.gpi
    ├── example.gto
    ├── example.plc
    ├── example.sol
    ├── example.stc
    └── example.sts
```

A more advanced example could be something like:

```
.
├── kitspace.yaml
└── manufacture
    ├── advanced-example-BOM.tsv
    └── gerbers-and-drills
        ├── advanced-example-B_Adhes.gba
        ├── advanced-example-B_CrtYd.gbr
        ├── advanced-example-B_Cu.gbl
        ├── advanced-example-B_Fab.gbr
        ├── advanced-example-B_Mask.gbs
        ├── advanced-example-B_Paste.gbp
        ├── advanced-example-B_SilkS.gbo
        ├── advanced-example.drl
        ├── advanced-example-Edge_Cuts.gbr
        ├── advanced-example-F_Adhes.gta
        ├── advanced-example-F_CrtYd.gbr
        ├── advanced-example-F_Cu.gtl
        ├── advanced-example-F_Fab.gbr
        ├── advanced-example-F_Mask.gts
        ├── advanced-example-F_Paste.gtp
        └── advanced-example-F_SilkS.gto
```

with `kitspace.yaml` containing:

```yaml
summary: A more advanced example
site: https://example.com
color: red
bom: manufacture/advanced-example-BOM.tsv
gerbers: manufacture/gerbers-and-drills
```

#### The multi field

Kitspace supports multiple projects in one repository with the `multi` field. When multiple projects exist, `multi` will always be the first field in the `kitspace.yaml`, with the paths to your projects folder nested underneath.

```
├── kitspace.yaml
├── project_one
│   ├── 1-click-bom.tsv
│   ├── README.md
│   └── gerbers
│       ├── example.cmp
│       ├── example.drd
│       ├── example.dri
│        ...
│       ├── example.stc
│       └── example.sts
└── project_two
    ├── 1-click-bom.tsv
    ├── README.md
    └── gerbers
        ├── example.cmp
        ├── example.drd
        ├── example.dri
         ...
        ├── example.stc
        └── example.sts

```

with `kitspace.yaml` containing:

```yaml
multi:
  project_one:
    summary: First project in a repository.
    color: blue
    site: https://example-one.com
  project_two:
    summary: Second project in a repository.
    color: red
    site: https://example-two.com
```

If you want to use custom paths for the `readme`, `bom`, or `gerbers` then note that these are from the root of the repository.

E.g.

```
├── kitspace.yaml
├── manufacturing_outputs
│   └── project_one_gerbers
│       ├── example.cmp
│       ├── example.drd
│       ├── example.dri
│        ...
│       ├── example.stc
│       └── example.sts
├── project_one
│   ├── documentation
│   │   └── README.md
    └── BOM.csv
└── project_two
    ...
```

```yaml
multi:
  project_one:
    readme: project_one/documentation/README.md
    bom: project_one/BOM.csv
    gerbers: manufacturing_outputs/project_one_gerbers
  project_two: ...
```

### Terms and conditions for adding a project

1. We (Kitspace developers) do not claim any ownership over your work, it remains yours.
2. By submitting your project you give us permission to host copies of your files for other people to download.
3. If you change your mind, you can remove your project any time by removing the project.

## Development

### Set Up

0. Get all the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace-v2
cd kitspace-v2
git submodule update --init
```

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [docker-compose](https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/) (on Ubuntu: `snap install docker` and `apt install docker-compose`)
2. Add the required lines to `/etc/hosts` (If you are not using Linux this probably won't work, please open an issue and we'll figure out how to support non-Linux development).

```
cat ./config/hosts | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

3. Copy the example .env

```
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Build and run the docker containers

```
docker-compose up
```

5. Go to [gitea.kitspace.test:3000/user/sign_up](http://gitea.kitspace.test:3000/user/sign_up) and create a new user. This will be the admin user.

## Frontend

The frontend is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) server in the [frontend directory](frontend/). Making edits on the code should auto compile and reload at [kitspace.test:3000](http://kitspace.test:3000).

Changing dependencies requires you to restart the development container:

```
cd frontend
yarn add <new dependency>
cd ..
docker-compose restart frontend
```

## Processor

This is a NodeJS program that processes all the assets and uploads them to an AWS S3 compatible service (in development we use Minio). As with the frontend, changing dependencies requires you to restart the development container.

You can run the processor test-suite, including integration tests by running `scripts/test_processor.sh`.

## Auto Deploys

This repo auto deploys the `master` branch (whether e2e tests pass or not) to our staging server.

- [master.staging.kitspace.dev](https://master.staging.kitspace.dev)

Open pull requests from trusted contributors that are not drafts get automatically merged into the `review` branch (reset to `master` before these auto-merges) and deployed to:

- [review.staging.kitspace.dev](https://review.staging.kitspace.dev)

We also auto deploy some development branches:

- [abdo-dev.staging.kitspace.dev](https://abdo-dev.staging.kitspace.dev) (from [abdo-dev](https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace-v2/tree/abdo-dev), [@AbdulrhmnGhanem](https://github.com/AbdulrhmnGhanem)'s branch)
- [kaspar-dev.staging.kitspace.dev](https://abdo-dev.staging.kitspace.dev) (from [kaspar-dev](https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace-v2/tree/kaspar-dev), [@kasbah](https://github.com/kasbah)'s branch)

### Docker Image Tags

When you notice issues in CI e2e or staging which you can't reproduce with the dev version then you can put something like this in .env:

```
FRONTEND_DEPLOY_IMAGE_TAG=:kaspar-dev
PROCESSOR_DEPLOY_IMAGE_TAG=:kaspar-dev
NGINX_DEPLOY_IMAGE_TAG=:kaspar-dev
```

and 

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.deploy.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml
```

to  try and reproduce the issue locally. 

## Ansible

We configure our staging servers using [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html). Our playbooks and roles are in the [ansible](ansible/) directory.


## Terraform

We configure infrstructure using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Our terraform files are in the [terraform](terraform/) directory.


## Running End-to-End Tests

Make sure that:
1. the frontend is being served at [http://kitspace.test:3000](http://kitspace.test:3000); by following the "Set Up" steps. You can use one of the following options.
2. test fixtures are generated: `scripts/generate_e2e_fixtures.sh`
3. npm packages are installed: `yarn --cwd e2e` (when running the tests outside of docker).


> Note: The GITEA_ADMIN_TOKEN is needed when because the Gitea service is hidden and inaccessible to other containers.

### 1. Run the tests in a docker container
```console
export CYPRESS_GITEA_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run ./scripts/importBoardsTxt.ts --tokenOnly)"
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up e2e
```
##



### 2. Without docker
```console
export CYPRESS_GITEA_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run ./scripts/importBoardsTxt.ts --tokenOnly)"
yarn --cwd e2e e2e
```

### 3. GUI
```console
export CYPRESS_GITEA_ADMIN_TOKEN="$(deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-run ./scripts/importBoardsTxt.ts --tokenOnly)"
yarn --cwd e2e gui
```



### Recording new visual tests:

1. Make sure you have Chrome installed on your machine.
2. Write the test in `cypress/integration/newTest.visual.spec.js`, See [IBOM.visual.spec.js](https://github.com/kitspace/kitspace-v2/blob/master/e2e/cypress/integration/IBOM.visual.spec.js) .
3. Run `./scripts/record_visual_spec.sh cypress/integration/newTest.visual.spec.js`.
